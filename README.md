# learning-lab
Making the most out of extraordinary times!

The goal is to spend at _least_ one hour a day learning something new! It could be a new recipe, a cool techonology, an obscure skill I might never use again, or some cool facts. I will create an issue _every_ day to share what I learned. My hope is to learn some new things and something about myself.
